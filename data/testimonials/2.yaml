text: "Kaitlyn is extraordinary. Within her first year at Inflection, she grew a functional expertise and created integrated processes to fulfill a business need that had not been addressed prior to her joining the company. I appreciate her proactivity, her follow-through in accomplishing what she has committed to with excellence, her strong communication skills, and the trust she inspires in her teammates. She is a delightful presence and also has a fun sense of humor. I hope our paths cross again!"
